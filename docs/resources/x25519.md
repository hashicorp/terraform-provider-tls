description: |-
  Creates a Curve25519 keypar. Curve25519 is a state-of-the-art Diffie-Hellman function suitable for a wide variety of applications (for example - WireGuard). Given a user's 32-byte secret key, Curve25519 computes the user's 32-byte public key. Given the user's 32-byte secret key and another user's 32-byte public key, Curve25519 computes a 32-byte secret shared by the two users. This secret can then be used to authenticate and encrypt messages between the two users.

# tls_x25519 (Resource)

Generates a secure private key and encodes it as base64. This resource is
primarily intended for easily bootstrapping throwaway development
environments.

~> **Important Security Notice** The private key generated by this resource will
be stored *unencrypted* in your Terraform state file. **Use of this resource
for production deployments is *not* recommended**. Instead, generate
a private key file outside of Terraform and distribute it securely
to the system where Terraform will be run.

This is a *logical resource*, so it contributes only to the current Terraform
state and does not create any external managed resources.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "tls_x25519" "example" {}
```

## Attributes Reference

The following attributes are exported:

* `private_key` - The private key data encoded in base64
* `public_key` - The public key data encoded in base64

## Generating a New Key

Since a private key is a logical resource that lives only in the Terraform state,
it will persist until it is explicitly destroyed by the user.

In order to force the generation of a new key within an existing state, the
private key instance can be "tainted":

```
terraform taint tls_x25519.example
```

A new key will then be generated on the next ``terraform apply``.
