# tls_cert_request (Resource)

Creates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in [PEM (RFC 1421)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1421) format.

PEM is the typical format used to request a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA).

This resource is intended to be used in conjunction with a Terraform provider for a particular certificate authority in order to provision a new certificate.

This is a *logical resource*, so it contributes only to the current Terraform
state and does not create any external managed resources.


## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "tls_cert_request" "example" {
  key_algorithm   = "ECDSA"
  private_key_pem = file("private_key.pem")

  subject {
    common_name  = "example.com"
    organization = "ACME Examples, Inc"
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `key_algorithm` (String) Name of the algorithm used when generating the private key provided in `private_key_pem`.
- `private_key_pem` (String, Sensitive) Private key in [PEM (RFC 1421)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1421) format, that the certificate will belong to. This can be read from a separate file using the [`file`](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/file) interpolation function. Only an irreversible secure hash of the private key will be stored in the Terraform state.
- `subject` (Block List, Min: 1) The subject for which a certificate is being requested. The acceptable arguments are all optional and their naming is based upon [Issuer Distinguished Names (RFC5280)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.4) section. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--subject))

### Optional

- `dns_names` (List of String) List of DNS names for which a certificate is being requested (i.e. certificate subjects).
- `ip_addresses` (List of String) List of IP addresses for which a certificate is being requested (i.e. certificate subjects).
- `uris` (List of String) List of URIs for which a certificate is being requested (i.e. certificate subjects).

### Read-Only

- `cert_request_pem` (String) The certificate request data in [PEM (RFC 1421)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1421) format.
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for this resource: hexadecimal representation of the SHA1 checksum of the resource.

- `organizational_unit` (String) Distinguished name: `OU`
- `postal_code` (String) Distinguished name: `PC`
- `province` (String) Distinguished name: `ST`
