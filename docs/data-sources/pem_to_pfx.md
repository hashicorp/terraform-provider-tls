# tls_pem_to_pfx (Data Source)

Converts a PEM certificate and private key into a PFX file. Encrypted PEM can be used if password_pem is given and the resulting PFX file can also be encrypted if password_pfx is given
Note:
Using modern encoding type which support advanced algorithms like AES256 encryption for securimng private keys to encrypt PFX certicate
Using rand.Reader to derive encryption keys from passwords but as per GO community, password encrypted pfx are not completely secure and can be broken

## Example Usage

```terraform
locals {
  certificate_path = "${path.module}/../../../internal/provider/fixtures/certificate_rsa_legacy.pem"
  private_key_path = "${path.module}/../../../internal/provider/fixtures/private_key_rsa_legacy.pem"
}

data "tls_pem_to_pfx" "this" {
  password_pfx    = ""
  certificate_pem = file(local.certificate_path)
  private_key_pem = file(local.private_key_path)
}

resource "local_sensitive_file" "example" {
  filename       = "${path.module}/output.pfx"
  content_base64 = data.tls_pem_to_pfx.this.certificate_pfx
}
```
