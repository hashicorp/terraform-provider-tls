# tls_pfx_to_pem (Data Source)

Convert PFX certificate to PEM format.

Note:
- PEM files are generated in PKCS#8 format, which is a generalized format for private keys that supports all algorithm types.
- Supported algorithm types include:
	- RSA
	- DSA
	- ECDSA
	- Elliptic Curve keys
	- EdDSA
- PKCS#8 format includes a field to specify the algorithm used for encryption, making it algorithm-agnostic.
- PKCS#1 is a legacy key format, specifically designed for a limited set of algorithm types in the context of modern cryptographic practices.

## Example Usage

```terraform
locals {
  pfx_file_path = "../../../internal/provider/fixtures/certificate_rsa_legacy.pfx"
}

data "tls_pfx_to_pem" "this" {
  content_base64 = filebase64(local.pfx_file_path)
  password       = ""
}

resource "local_sensitive_file" "certificate_pem" {
  filename = "${path.module}/certificate.pem"
  content  = data.tls_pfx_to_pem.this.certificate_pem
}

resource "local_sensitive_file" "private_key" {
  filename = "${path.module}/private_key.pem"
  content  = data.tls_pfx_to_pem.this.private_key_pem
}
```
