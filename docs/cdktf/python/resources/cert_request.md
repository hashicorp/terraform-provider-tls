# tls_cert_request (Resource)

Creates a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in [PEM (RFC 1421)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1421) format.

PEM is the typical format used to request a certificate from a Certificate Authority (CA).

This resource is intended to be used in conjunction with a Terraform provider for a particular certificate authority in order to provision a new certificate.

This is a *logical resource*, so it contributes only to the current Terraform
state and does not create any external managed resources.


## Example Usage

```python
# DO NOT EDIT. Code generated by 'cdktf convert' - Please report bugs at https://cdk.tf/bug
from constructs import Construct
from cdktf import Fn, Token, TerraformStack
#
# Provider bindings are generated by running `cdktf get`.
# See https://cdk.tf/provider-generation for more details.
#
from imports.tls.cert_request import CertRequest
class MyConvertedCode(TerraformStack):
    def __init__(self, scope, name):
        super().__init__(scope, name)
        CertRequest(self, "example",
            private_key_pem=Token.as_string(Fn.file("private_key.pem")),
            subject=CertRequestSubject(
                common_name="example.com",
                organization="ACME Examples, Inc"
            )
        )
```

## Schema

### Required

- `private_key_pem` (String, Sensitive) Private key in [PEM (RFC 1421)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1421) format, that the certificate will belong to. This can be read from a separate file using the [`file`](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/file) interpolation function.

### Optional

- `dns_names` (List of String) List of DNS names for which a certificate is being requested (i.e. certificate subjects).
- `ip_addresses` (List of String) List of IP addresses for which a certificate is being requested (i.e. certificate subjects).
- `subject` (Block List) The subject for which a certificate is being requested. The acceptable arguments are all optional and their naming is based upon [Issuer Distinguished Names (RFC5280)](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5280#section-4.1.2.4) section. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedblock--subject))
- `uris` (List of String) List of URIs for which a certificate is being requested (i.e. certificate subjects).

### Read-Only

- `cert_request_pem` (String) The certificate request data in [PEM (RFC 1421)](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1421) format. **NOTE**: the [underlying](https://pkg.go.dev/encoding/pem#Encode) [libraries](https://pkg.go.dev/golang.org/x/crypto/ssh#MarshalAuthorizedKey) that generate this value append a `\n` at the end of the PEM. In case this disrupts your use case, we recommend using [`trimspace()`](https://www.terraform.io/language/functions/trimspace).
- `id` (String) Unique identifier for this resource: hexadecimal representation of the SHA1 checksum of the resource.
- `key_algorithm` (String) Name of the algorithm used when generating the private key provided in `private_key_pem`.

<a id="nestedblock--subject"></a>
### Nested Schema for `subject`

Optional:

- `common_name` (String) Distinguished name: `CN`
- `country` (String) Distinguished name: `C`
- `locality` (String) Distinguished name: `L`
- `organization` (String) Distinguished name: `O`
- `organizational_unit` (String) Distinguished name: `OU`
- `postal_code` (String) Distinguished name: `PC`
- `province` (String) Distinguished name: `ST`
- `serial_number` (String) Distinguished name: `SERIALNUMBER`
- `street_address` (List of String) Distinguished name: `STREET`
