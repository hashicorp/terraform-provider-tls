## Example Usage

## Schema

### Required

- `url` (String) The URL of the website to get the certificates from.

### Optional

- `verify_chain` (Boolean) Whether to verify the certificate chain while parsing it or not (default: `true`).

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier of this data source: randomly generated string (UTC time when data source was read).
- `certificates` (List of Object) The certificates protecting the site, with the root of the chain first. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--certificates))

### Nested Schema for `certificates`

Read-Only:

- `is_ca` (Boolean) `true` if the certificate is of a CA (Certificate Authority).
- `issuer` (String) Who verified and signed the certificate, roughly following [RFC2253](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2253).
- `not_after` (String) The time until which the certificate is invalid, as an [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp.
- `not_before` (String) The time after which the certificate is valid, as an [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) timestamp.
- `public_key_algorithm` (String) The key algorithm used to create the certificate.
- `serial_number` (String) Number that uniquely identifies the certificate with the CA's system.
  The `format` function can be used to convert this _base 10_ number into other bases, such as hex.
- `sha1_fingerprint` (String) The SHA1 fingerprint of the public key of the certificate.
- `signature_algorithm` (String) The algorithm used to sign the certificate.
- `subject` (String) The entity the certificate belongs to, roughly following [RFC2253](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2253).
- `version` (Number) The version the certificate is in.
