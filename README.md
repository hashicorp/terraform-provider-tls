# Terraform Provider: TLS

The TLS provider provides utilities for working with *Transport Layer Security*
keys and certificates. It provides resources that
allow private keys, certificates and certificate requests to be
created as part of a Terraform deployment.

## Documentation, questions and discussions

Official documentation on how to use this provider can be found on the 
[Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/tls/latest/docs).
In case of specific questions or discussions, please use the 
[HashiCorp Terraform providers Discuss](https://discuss.hashicorp.com/c/terraform-providers/31). 

The remainder of this document will focus on the development aspects of the provider.

## Requirements

* [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) (>= 0.12)
* [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) (1.17)
* [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
* [golangci-lint](https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation) (optional)

## Building

1. `git clone` this repository and `cd` into its directory
2. `make` will trigger the Golang build

The provided `GNUmakefile` defines additional commands generally useful during development,
like for running tests, generating documentation, code formatting and linting.
Taking a look at it's content is recommended.

### Testing

In order to test the provider, you can run

* `make test` to run provider tests
* `make testacc` to run provider acceptance tests

It's important to note that acceptance tests (`testacc`) will actually spawn
`terraform` and the provider. Read more about they work on the
[official page](https://www.terraform.io/plugin/sdkv2/testing/acceptance-tests).

### Generating documentation

This provider uses [terraform-plugin-docs](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-plugin-docs/)
to generate documentation and store it in the `docs/` directory.
Once a release is cut, the Terraform Registry will download the documentation from `docs/`
and associate it with the release version. Read more about how this works on the
[official page](https://www.terraform.io/registry/providers/docs).

Use `make generate` to ensure the documentation is regenerated with any changes.


## Releasing

The release process is automated via GitHub Actions,
and it's defined in the Workflow [release.yml](./.github/workflows/release.yml).

Each release is cut by pushing a [semantically versioned](https://semver.org/)
tag to the default branch.
